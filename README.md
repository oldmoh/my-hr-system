# My HR System

This is a project simulating a user control system meant for practing Laravel.

Here are the system requirements:

- Build the user table with email, name, password, and department fields at least.
A user could only belong to one department.

- Users need to login via email and password to access the UI.

- All the users in this company should be able to see the other people email, name, and department through UI.

- All the users in this company should be able to search other people by email, name, or department through UI.

- Only users in the HR department would be able to create users through the UI.

- Only users in the HR department would be able to update users' departments through UI.

- Only the user could update his own password.
We need the log table to track on the change. It doesn't need to have a UI interface yet. But we want to be able to figure out two things. 1. who has modified a specific user. 2. How many users has this specific user has been modified.

There are four deparments.

- HR
- DEV
- SALE
- CS
